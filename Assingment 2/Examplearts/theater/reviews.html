     <h3><dt>the ArcLight</dt></h3>
     <dd>A Hollywood favorite since 2002, the ArcLight offers comfortable assigned seating (cushy, reclining, leg room for days), state-of-the-art sight and sound, fantastic snack bars and, for some Dionysian indulgence, an in-house caf√©-bar. The programming is an astute mix of first-run flicks, indies, foreign fare and premieres, and alcohol is allowed in some screenings. As an added bonus, there are always fun cinephile treats on display (original costumes, architectural models, etc.). It's the most appealing modern multiplex in LA, but it's also a classic due to the Cinerama Dome, a fabulous and unique domed movie theater that opened in 1963. Note that parking is usually pretty rough: there's a garage that validates but it gets pretty packed, so allow plenty of time to find a space and don't expect to escape quickly.</dd>

     <h3><dt>Vista Theater</dt></h3>
     <dd>The historic single-screen Vista Theater plays movies on actual film reels (no digital here) and boasts giant Art Deco light fixtures, kitschy Egyptian-themed wall details and a lovely manager, Victor Martinez, who dresses up for every opening (think: Willy Wonka for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the Joker for The Dark Knight, etc.). The theater is by no means luxury (although the leg room is pretty spectacular), but it's got character and is within walking distance of Silver Lake, Los Feliz and East Hollywood, making it an extra appealing option for Eastsiders.</dd>

     <h3><dt>Cinespia</dt></h3>
     <dd>John Wyatt is the mastermind behind the outdoor Cinespia screenings, a rite of passage for Angelenos in the summertime and one of the best outdoor activities the city has to offer. A slide show of vintage film posters and a mood-setting DJ combine to relax the picnicking crowd at this famous cemetery before the main event: A classic (both black-and-white and contemporary apply here) film projected onto a wall of one of the larger mausoleums. The carpe diem ambience enchants, though the fact that alcohol is permitted also helps. And the line to get inside is always an event of its own, with moviegoers setting up lawn chairs and breaking out the snacks long before the gates open.</dd>
